1. For Loop
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known. 
It runs a block of code a specific number of times by controlling the loop counter with initialization, condition, and update steps in one place.

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be executed
}

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

2.while 

 The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. It keeps running a block of code as long as a given condition remains true. The condition is checked before the loop executes each time.

 Syntax:
 while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}

int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}

3.Do while 

 The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before the condition is checked, since the condition is evaluated after the block is executed.
syntax:
 do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);

int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
